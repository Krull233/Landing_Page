# Landing_Page

I'm so excited to begin working on the Landing Page project. I'm hoping to really cement some of the concepts that The Odin Project has begun teaching me.

I had a few days of false starts due to having a lot of trouble learning flexbox. But I finally got it! My project is complete.
